# Project overview

This OOP2 lab tackled the producer-consumer problem. 

It also involved threads, concurrency, locks, and using a web API.

We used a web API to get data from the [Open Notify Project](http://open-notify.org/) 
about the number of times and predicted times the International Space Station will pass
over particular cities. The cities we used are read from a spreadsheet and parsed into a list of city objects.
